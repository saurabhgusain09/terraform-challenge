# 🚀 Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Portfolio

This repository showcases my hands-on work with **Terraform**, focused on building, managing, and scaling cloud infrastructure using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles.

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate **real-world Terraform usage**, clean project structure, and a strong understanding of how modern infrastructure is designed, versioned, and automated.

---

## 🧠 What This Repository Represents

This is **not just Terraform code**.

It reflects:
- How I think about infrastructure
- How I structure IaC projects
- How I move from basic concepts to production-grade setups
- How infrastructure should be **repeatable, auditable, and scalable**

> Infrastructure should be treated like software — versioned, reviewed, and automated.

## 🔧 Why Terraform?
Terraform enables teams to:
- Define cloud infrastructure using declarative code
- Eliminate manual configuration drift
- Safely plan and apply infrastructure changes
- Recreate environments reliably (dev, staging, prod)

In short:
> **Terraform turns infrastructure into predictable code.**

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized in a **day-wise / topic-wise learning and implementation format**, where each folder is self-contained and production-inspired.
